  Hi, my name's Dongik and I'm an enthusiastic artificial intelligence researcher. I was a master's student at Korea university, and I am currently looking to study abroad.
  My primary research interest lies in computer vision and machine perception. 
  Specifically, I am eager to explore problems related to bridging gaps between domains and techniques for understanding the decision-making processes of models. 
  Moreover, I am interested in working on how to optimize and apply models in specific fields such as healthcare. 

  In addition to being an AI researcher, I am enthusiastically working toward improvement. I'm still working on my personal page.

          During my masterâ€™s program at Korea university, I took on the challenge of entering the field of artificial intelligence for the first time. 
          I conducted research in the area of computer vision using medical data.
          I developed methodology for lesion segmentation in ultrasound images and designed an application with graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate segmentation tasks. 
          As part of the project, I also designed a pipeline for effective alignment of datasets to ensure compatibility between external and internal datasets.

          During my time at Korea university, I learnt most of my key skills about computer science. 
          I thoroughly enjoyed my time on campus and learned a lot, from fundamental theory to application across fields, with information theory being my most memorable and fasinating course work.
