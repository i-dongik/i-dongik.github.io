  Hi, my name's Dongik and I'm an enthusiastic artificial intelligence researcher. I was a master student at Korea university. I am currently looking to study abroad.
  As well as AI researcher I am also interested in real estate, public and civil law, so I am studying to earn a real estate agent license.
  My CV may not be impressive, but I am enthusiastically working towards improvement. I'm still working on my personal page.

          During my masterâ€™s program at Korea university, I took on the challenge of entering the field of artificial intelligence for the first time. I conducted research in the area of computer vision using medical data.
          I developed methodology for lesion segmentation in ultrasound images and designed an application with graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate segmentation tasks. Specifically, I integrated a model with a layer by adapting the foundation model for domain with its heterogeneity. As part of the project, I also designed a pipeline for effective alignment of datasets to ensure compatibility between external and internal datasets.
